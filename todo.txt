- add ability to add planets to a local database
- add ability to output as pdf or html
- power spectrum of star from kepler 
- add support for using the multiexopars and koi database in addition to confirmed planets
- add ability to grab transits for a window (besides next 1 year)

Getting a list of planets in a given range of parameter space will be faster 
if done at the database level rather than by running through all the planets 
at the level of my code.
